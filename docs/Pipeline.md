# CI/CD Pipeline
## CI/CD Pipeline Environment

Our CI/CD pipeline operates within a containerized development environment facilitated by Docker devcontainer, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different stages of the software development lifecycle.

### Infrastructure and Environment Description:

- **Operating System:** Docker devcontainer provides a standardized development environment regardless of the host operating system, ensuring compatibility and consistency among developers working on various platforms.

- **Cloud Services:** While our CI/CD pipeline primarily relies on local development environments created by Docker devcontainer, the GitHub repository serves as a centralized location for version control, collaboration, and automated CI/CD workflows.

- **Network Configurations:** Docker devcontainer manages networking configurations internally, ensuring isolation and security within the development environment. Communication with external services, such as the GitHub repository, is established through standard network protocols.

### GitHub Repository Integration:

Our CI/CD pipeline leverages a GitHub repository as the central hub for version control and automation triggers. The repository hosts the codebase, along with configuration files for CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions.

## CI/CD Pipeline Tools

## Tool Selection and Justification

1. **Docker**: Docker serves as a crucial component in our CI/CD pipeline, facilitating containerization of applications. This ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages, mitigating potential deployment issues caused by environment discrepancies.

2. **GitHub Actions**: We leverage GitHub Actions for its native integration with our version control repository hosted on GitHub. Its YAML-based workflow configuration simplifies the definition of CI/CD pipelines directly within the repository, streamlining the development workflow.

## Automation Process

### Code Compilation
- Upon triggering a CI/CD workflow (e.g., on a new commit or pull request), the pipeline fetches the latest code from the GitHub repository.
- The Flutter project is built using the appropriate Flutter SDK version specified in the project configuration.

### Unit Testing
- After successful compilation, the pipeline executes unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components within the Flutter website.
- Flutter provides a testing framework for unit tests that can be executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### Integration Testing
- Following the completion of unit tests, integration testing is initiated to validate the interaction between different pages or components within the Flutter website.
- Integration tests can be written using Flutter's integration testing framework, which allows for testing user interactions and UI behavior.

### Deployment to Staging Environment
- Upon passing all tests, the pipeline deploys the built Flutter website to a staging environment for further validation.
- The staging environment may be hosted on a cloud platform such as Firebase Hosting or GitHub Pages.

### Staging Environment Testing
- Testers and stakeholders perform manual or automated tests on the deployed Flutter website in the staging environment.
- Various testing techniques, such as usability testing, browser compatibility testing, and performance testing, may be employed to ensure the website meets quality standards.

### Automated Approval Process
- If required, an automated approval process may be implemented to ensure that only approved changes are promoted to production.
- This process may involve gating deployments based on predefined criteria, such as passing specific test suites or obtaining approvals from designated approvers.

### Deployment to Production Environment
- Once the Flutter website passes all tests and receives necessary approvals, the pipeline automatically promotes the build to the production environment.
- The deployment process to the production environment is similar to that of the staging environment but may involve additional validation steps or safeguards to minimize downtime and ensure reliability.
